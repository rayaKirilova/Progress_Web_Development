    <h1>Terry Pratchett</h1>
    <hr>

    <p><b>Sir Terence David John Pratchett</b> OBE (28 April 1948 – 12 March 2015) was an English humorist, satirist,
        and author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his <strong>Discworld</strong>
        series of 41 novels.
    <p> Pratchett's first novel, The Carpet People, was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, The Colour of
        Magic, was published in 1983, after which Pratchett wrote an average of two books a year. The final Discworld
        novel, The Shepherd's Crown, was published in August 2015, five months after his death.</p>
    <p> Pratchett, with more than 85 million books sold worldwide in 37 languages, was the UK's best-selling author of
        the 1990s. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted for
        services to literature in the 2009 New Year Honours. In 2001 he won the annual Carnegie Medal for The Amazing
        Maurice and his Educated Rodents, the first Discworld book marketed for children. He received the World Fantasy
        Award for Life Achievement in 2010.</p>
    <p> In December 2007, Pratchett announced that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. He later
        made a substantial public donation to the Alzheimer's Research Trust, filmed a television programme chronicling
        his experiences with the condition for the BBC, and became a patron for Alzheimer's Research UK. Pratchett died
        on 12 March 2015, aged 66.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <h3>§ Early life</h3>
        <p>Pratchett was born on 28 April 1948 in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, England, the only child of David
            (1921–2006), a mechanic, and Eileen Pratchett (1922–2010), a secretary, of Hay-on-Wye. His maternal
            grandparents came from Ireland Pratchett attended Holtspur School, where he was bullied for his speech
            impediments. He was bothered by the head teacher, who, he said, thought "he could tell how successful you
            were going to be in later life by how well you could read or write at the age of six".</p> 
            <p> Pratchett's family
            moved to Bridgwater, Somerset, briefly in 1957. He passed his eleven plus exam in 1959, earning a place at
            High Wycombe Technical High School, where he was a key member of the debating society and wrote stories for
            the school magazine. Pratchett described himself as a "non-descript" student and, in his Who's Who entry,
            credits his education to the Beaconsfield Public Library.</p> 
            <p> Pratchett's early interests included astronomy. He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned a telescope and wanted to be an astronomer, but lacked the necessary mathematical skills. He developed an interest in science fiction and attended science fiction conventions from about 1963–1964, but stopped a few years later when he got his first job as a trainee journalist at the local paper. His early reading included the works of H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and "every book you really ought to read", which he later regarded as "getting an education".</p>
            <p> Pratchett
            published his first short story, "Business Rivals", in the High Wycombe Technical School magazine in 1962.
            It is the tale of a man named Crucible who finds the Devil in his flat in a cloud of sulphurous smoke. "The
            Hades Business", which was published in the school magazine when he was 13, was published commercially when
            he was 15.</p>
            <p> Pratchett earned five O-levels and started A-level courses in Art, English and History. His
            initial career choice was journalism and he left school at 17, in 1965, to start an apprenticeship with
            Arthur Church, the editor of the Bucks Free Press. In this position he wrote, among other things, over 80
            stories for the Children's Circle section under the name Uncle Jim. Two of the stories contain characters
            found in his novel The Carpet People (1971). While on day release from his apprenticeship, Pratchett
            finished his A-Level in English and took the National Council for the Training of Journalists proficiency
            course.</p>

        <h3>§ Career</h3>
        <p>In 1968, Pratchett interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director of a small publishing company, Colin
            Smythe Ltd. Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript, The Carpet People. Colin Smythe Ltd published
            the book in 1971, with illustrations by Pratchett. It received strong, although few, reviews and was
            followed by the science fiction novels The Dark Side of the Sun (10 May 1976) and Strata (15 June 1981).</p>
           <p>After various positions in journalism, in 1980 Pratchett became Press Officer for the Central Electricity
            Generating Board (CEGB) in an area that covered four nuclear power stations. He later joked that he had
            demonstrated "impeccable timing" by making this career change so soon after the Three Mile Island nuclear
            accident in Pennsylvania, US, and said he would "write a book about my experiences, if I thought anyone
            would believe it".</p>
            <p>The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in hardback by Colin Smythe
            Ltd in 1983. The paperback edition was published by Corgi, an imprint of Transworld, in 1985. Pratchett's
            popularity increased when the BBC's Woman's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts, and
            later Equal Rites. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd,
            which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, Colin Smythe having become Pratchett's agent. Pratchett was
            the first fantasy author published by Gollancz.</p>
            <p>Pratchett gave up working for the CEGB to make his living
            through writing in 1987, after finishing the fourth Discworld novel, Mort. His sales increased quickly and
            many of his books occupied top places on the best-seller list; he was the UK's best-selling author of the
            1990s. According to The Times, Pratchett was the top-selling and highest earning UK author in 1996. Some of
            his books have been published by Doubleday, another Transworld imprint. In the US, Pratchett is published by
            HarperCollins.</p>
            <p>According to the Bookseller's Pocket Yearbook (2005), in 2003 Pratchett's UK sales amounted
            to 3.4% of the fiction market by hardback sales and 3.8% by value, putting him in second place behind J. K.
            Rowling (6% and 5.6%, respectively), while in the paperback sales list Pratchett came 5th with 1.2% and 1.3%
            by value (behind James Patterson (1.9% and 1.7%), Alexander McCall Smith, John Grisham, and J. R. R.
            Tolkien). He has UK sales of more than 2.5 million copies a year. His 2011 Discworld novel Snuff became the
            third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies
            in the first three days.</p>

        <h3>§ Alzheimer's disease</h3>
        <p>In August 2007, Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke a few years before, which doctors
            believed had damaged the right side of his brain. In December 2007, he announced that he had been newly
            diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which had been responsible for the "stroke". He had a rare
            form of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a disease in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink
            and shrivel.</p>
            <p>Describing the diagnosis as an "embuggerance" in a radio interview, Pratchett appealed to
            people to "keep things cheerful" and proclaimed that "we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and
            possibly with a mild optimism". He stated he felt he had time for "at least a few more books yet", and added
            that while he understood the impulse to ask "is there anything I can do?", in this case he would only
            entertain such offers from "very high-end experts in brain chemistry." Discussing his diagnosis at the Bath
            Literature Festival in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write
            dedications when signing books. In his later years Pratchett wrote by dictating to his assistant, Rob
            Wilkins, or by using speech recognition software.</p>

            <p>In March 2008, Pratchett announced he would donate
            US$1,000,000 (about £494,000) to the Alzheimer's Research Trust, and that he was shocked "to find out that
            funding for Alzheimer's research is just 3% of that to find cancer cures." He said: "I am, along with many
            others, scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along."</p>

            <p>In April 2008, Pratchett worked with the BBC to make a two-part documentary series about his illness, Terry
            Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer's. The first part was broadcast on BBC Two on 4 February 2009, drawing
            2.6 million viewers and a 10.4% audience share. The second, broadcast on 11 February 2009, drew 1.72
            million viewers and a 6.8% audience share. The documentary won a BAFTA award in the Factual Series
            category.</p>

            <p>On 26 November 2008, Pratchett met the Prime Minister Gordon Brown and asked for an increase in dementia
            research funding. Pratchett tested a prototype device to address his condition. The ability of
            the device to alter the course of the illness has been met with skepticism from Alzheimer's researchers.</p>

            <p>In an article published 2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide, a term he
            disliked, before his disease progressed to a critical point. He later said he felt "it should be
            possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with
            medical help, rather than suffer". Pratchett was selected to give the 2010 BBC Richard Dimbleby
            Lecture, Shaking Hands With Death, broadcast on 1 February 2010. Pratchett introduced his lecture on
            the topic of assisted death, but the main text was read by his friend Tony Robinson because his condition
            made it difficult for him to read. In June 2011, Pratchett presented a BBC television documentary, Terry
            Pratchett: Choosing to Die, about assisted suicide. It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish BAFTAs
            in November 2011.</p>

            <p>In September 2012, Pratchett told an interviewer: "I have to tell you that I thought I'd be a lot worse than
            this by now, and so did my specialist." In the same interview, he said that the cognitive part of his mind
            was "untouched" and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA). However, in July 2014, he cancelled his
            appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, citing his condition and "other age-related
            ailments".</p>

        <h3>§ Death</h3>
        <p>Pratchett died at his home on the morning of 12 March 2015 from Alzheimer's. The Telegraph reported an
            unidentified source as saying that despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide, his death had been
            natural.</p>
    
           <p>Public figures who paid tribute include British Prime Minister David Cameron, comedian Ricky Gervais,
            and authors Ursula K. Le Guin, Terry Brooks, Margaret Atwood, George R. R. Martin, and Neil Gaiman.
            Pratchett was memorialised in graffiti in East London. The video game companies Frontier
            Developments and Valve added elements to their games named after him. Users of the social news site
            Reddit organised a tribute by which an HTTP header, "X-Clacks-Overhead: GNU Terry Pratchett", was added to
            web sites' responses, a reference to the Discworld novel Going Postal, in which "the clacks" (Discworld's
            equivalent to a telegraph) are programmed to repeat the name of its creator's deceased son; the sentiment in
            the novel is that no one is ever forgotten as long as their name is still spoken. A June 2015 web server
            survey reported that approximately 84,000 websites had been configured with the header.</p>

            <p>Pratchett's humanist funeral service was held on 25 March 2015.</p>

    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>Pratchett married Lyn Purves at the Congregational Church, Gerrards Cross, on 5 October 1968. They moved to Rowberrow, Somerset, in 1970. Their daughter Rhianna Pratchett, also a writer, was born there in 1976. In 1993, the family moved to Broad Chalke, a village west of Salisbury, Wiltshire. He was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library. In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library which he had visited as a child and donated the income from the event to it. He also visited his former school to speak to the students.</p>

     <p>Pratchett often wore large, black hats, a style described as "more that of urban cowboy than city gent". Concern for the future of civilisation prompted him to install five kilowatts of photovoltaic cells (for solar energy) at his house.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <h3>§ Computing</h3>
        <p>Pratchett started to use computers for writing as soon as they were available to him. His first computer was a Sinclair ZX81; the first computer he used properly for writing was an Amstrad CPC 464, later replaced by a PC. Pratchett was one of the first authors to routinely use the Internet to communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992. However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another "thing to use". He had many computers in his house, with a bank of six monitors rigged up to ease writing. When he travelled, he always took a portable computer with him to write.</p>

        <p>In a 1995 interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Pratchett expressed concern about the potential spread of misinformation online. He felt that there was a "kind of parity of esteem of information" on the internet, and gave the example of holocaust denial being presented on the same terms as peer-reviewed research, with no easy way to gauge reliability. Gates disagreed, saying that online authorities would index and check facts and sources in a much more sophisticated way than in print. The interview was rediscovered in 2019, and seen by Pratchett's biographer as prescient of fake news.</p>
            
        <p>Pratchett was an avid video game player, and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books. He favoured games that are "intelligent and have some depth", citing Half-Life 2 (2004) and fan missions from Thief as examples. The red army in Interesting Times alludes to the game Lemmings, and when asked about this connection, Pratchett stated, "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that ... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back." He described Oblivion (2006) as "wonderful", and used many of its non-combat-oriented fan-made mods. Pratchett wrote dialogue for an Oblivion mod which added a Nord companion named Vilja. He also worked on a similar mod for Skyrim (2011) which featured Vilja's great-great-granddaughter.</p>

        <h3>§ Natural history</h3>
        <p>Pratchett had a fascination with natural history that he referred to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of carnivorous plants. He described them in the biographical notes on the dust jackets of some of his books, and elsewhere, as "not as interesting as people think". By Carpe Jugulum the account had become that he used to, but the plants had taken over the greenhouse, and he avoided going in.</p>

        <p>   In 1995, a fossil sea-turtle from the Eocene epoch of New Zealand was named Psephophorus terrypratchetti in his honour by the palaeontologist Richard Köhler.</p>
            
        <p>In 2016, Pratchett fans petitioned the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to name chemical element 117, temporarily called ununseptium, as octarine with the proposed symbol Oc (pronounced "ook"). The final name chosen for element 117 was tennessine with the symbol Ts.</p>
            
        <p>  Pratchett was a trustee for Orangutan Foundation but was pessimistic about the future of orangutans. His activities included visiting Borneo with a Channel 4 film crew to make an episode of "Jungle Quest" in 1995, seeing orangutans in their natural habitat. Following Pratchett's lead, fan events such as the Discworld Conventions have adopted Orangutan Foundation as their nominated charity, which has been acknowledged by the foundation. One of Pratchett's most popular fictional characters, the Librarian, is a wizard who was transformed into an orangutan in a magical accident and decides to remain in that condition as it is so convenient for his work.</p>

        <h3>§ Amateur astronomy</h3>
        <p>Pratchett had an observatory built into in his back garden and was a keen astronomer from childhood. He made an appearance on the BBC programme The Sky at Night.</p>

        <h3>§ Terry Pratchett First Novel Award</h3>
        <p>Pratchett sponsored a biennial award for unpublished science fiction novelists, the Terry Pratchett First Novel Award. The prize is a publishing contract with his publishers Transworld. In 2011 the award was won jointly by David Logan for Half Sick of Shadows and Michael Logan for Apocalypse Cow. In 2013 the award was won by Alexander Maskill for The Hive.</p>

        <h3>§ Sir Terry Pratchett Memorial Scholarship</h3>
        <p>In 2015, Pratchett's estate announced an in-perpetuity endowment to the University of South Australia. The Sir Terry Pratchett Memorial Scholarship supports a Masters scholarship at the University's Hawke Research Institute.</p>

        <h3>§ Views on religion</h3>
        <p>Pratchett, who was brought up in a Church of England family, described himself as atheist and a humanist. He was a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society.</p>

         <p>Pratchett wrote that he read the Old Testament as a child and "was horrified", but liked the New Testament and thought that Jesus "had a lot of good things to say ... But I could never see the two testaments as one coherent narrative." He then read On the Origin of Species, which "all made perfect sense ... Evolution was far more thrilling to me than the biblical account." He said he had never disliked religion and thought it had a purpose in human evolution. In his novel Nation, the protagonist says "It is better to build a seismograph than to worship the volcano", a statement Pratchett said he agreed with.</p>
            
        <p>Pratchett told the Times in 2008: "I believe in the same God that Einstein did ... And it is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that on the other side of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows." In an interview on Front Row, he described an experience hearing his deceased father's voice and feeling a sense of peace. Commentators took these statements to mean Pratchett had become religious; Pratchett responded in an article published in the Daily Mail in which he denied that he had found God, and clarified that he believed the "voice in his head" had come from a memory of his father and sense of personal elation.</p>

        <h2>Awards and honours</h2>

        <h3>Author</h3>
        <p>Pratchett received a knighthood for "services to literature" in the 2009 UK New Year Honours list. He was previously appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, also for "services to literature", in 1998. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Pratchett commented in the Ansible SF/fan newsletter, "I suspect the 'services to literature' consisted of refraining from trying to write any," but added, "Still, I cannot help feeling mightily chuffed about it." On 31 December 2008, it was announced that Pratchett would be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. Afterwards he said, "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword."</p>

        <p>Pratchett was the British Book Awards' 'Fantasy and Science Fiction Author of the Year' for 1994.</p>
            
        <p>In 2003, BBC conducted The Big Read to identify the "Nation's Best-loved Novel" and finally published a ranked list of the "Top 200". Pratchett's highest-ranking novel was Mort, number 65, but he and Charles Dickens were the only authors with five in the Top 100 (four of his were from the Discworld series). He also led all authors with fifteen novels in the Top 200.</p>
            
        <p>Pratchett received the NESFA Skylark Award in 2009 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010. In 2011 he won Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association, a lifetime honour for "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature". The librarians cited nine Discworld novels published from 1983 to 2004 and observed that "Pratchett's tales of Discworld have won over generations of teen readers with intelligence, heart, and undeniable wit. Comic adventures that fondly mock the fantasy genre, the Discworld novels expose the hypocrisies of contemporary society in an intricate, ever-expanding universe. With satisfyingly multilayered plots, Pratchett's humor honors the intelligence of the reader. Teens eagerly lose themselves in a universe with no maps."</p>
            
        <p>Pratchett was awarded ten honorary doctorates: University of Warwick in 1999, the Univerity of Portsmouth in 2001, the University of Bath in 2003, the University of Bristol in 2004, Buckinghamshire New University in 2008, the University of Dublin in 2008, Bradford University in 2009, University of Winchester in 2009, The Open University in 2013 for his contribution to Public Service and his last, from the University of South Australia, in May 2014.</p>
            
        <p>He was made an adjunct Professor in the School of English at Trinity College Dublin in 2010, with a role in postgraduate education in creative writing and popular literature.</p>

        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>Pratchett won the British Science Fiction Award in 1989 for his novel Pyramids, and a Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2008 for Making Money.</p>

        <p>Pratchett won the 2001 Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents as the year's best children's book published in the UK.</p>
                
        <p>Night Watch won the 2003 Prometheus Award for best libertarian novel.</p>
                
        <p>Three of the five Discworld novels that centre on the "trainee witch" Tiffany Aching won the annual Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book in 2004, 2005 and 2007.</p>
                
        <p>In 2005, Going Postal was shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel; however, Pratchett recused himself, stating that stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of Worldcon.</p>
                
        <p>I Shall Wear Midnight won the 2010 Andre Norton Award for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) as a part of the Nebula Award ceremony. In 2016, SFWA announced that Sir Terry would be the recipient of the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award, presented at the 2016 SFWA Nebula Conference.</p>

        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>An asteroid (127005 Pratchett) is named after him.</p>

        <p>In 2013, Pratchett was named Humanist of the Year by the British Humanist Association for his campaign to fund research into Alzheimers, his contribution to the right to die public debate and his Humanist values.</p>

        <h3>Fanbase</h3>
        <p>Pratchett's Discworld novels have led to dedicated conventions, the first in Manchester in 1996, then worldwide, often with the author as guest of honour. Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour; queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received a large amount of fan mail from them.
